## Overview

The personalized recommendation system is designed to provide users with tailored product recommendations based on their ratings and reviews. It leverages machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends products based on similarities between users' ratings.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests products based on product features and user preferences.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes user reviews to further refine recommendations.
- **Web Interface**: Users can log in, view their recommendations, and adjust preferences.
- **Docker Support**: The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10**
- **Flask**: Web framework used to build the web interface.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms.
- **Transformers & PyTorch**: NLP for sentiment analysis.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application.
- **HTML & CSS**: Front-end design and layout.
